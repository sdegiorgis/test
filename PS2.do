*First I need to clean up the zip codes in my subsample because they are zip+4 and I just want the 5 digit zip code
*So I can see that all the zip codes in my subsample are a string.  Also most are 9 characters but a few are only 5 and some have a hyphen before the +4
*I think I would like to recode so they're all 5 numbers

edit //it worked!  there is one missing variable bc there was one missing zip_code in the subsample
