edit //this is a dataset from ACS with total number of occupied units per zip code and mortgage characteristics

*above is just a graph of the number of housing units in each zip code.  How do I get rid of the zip codes with no housing units?  Or should I drop them from my dataset before graphing?
//can keep them, it may be helpful to know some are like this; or if you want to drop them, just say drop if sth or keep if sth
*Now I want to graph the total number of housing units and the number of housing units with a mortgage in each zip code

*okay this is generally what I wanted, going to try to make it look nicer

*yeah, kinda - how do I make the legend smaller?
//use GUI, iknow your computer doesnt work, but just use the lab
//ask Shourjya, Straso or me for the key and can use it any time :)

//this is a great start, but need some more graphs, and start formulating your research hypotheses and answering them with graphs
//looking forward to more!
